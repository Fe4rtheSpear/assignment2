Everything up-to-date

2.) There have been 10 commits by me or by others

4.)Branches are used in a Git repository because they
allow you to develop things safely in a contained area of 
the repository. They also can store information that can be pushed
into a GitHub site, or pulled into another branch

5.)Git log: Displays committed snapshots. It lists the projected history, filter it, and search 
for specific changes.
Git status: Displays the state of the working directory and the staging area,
letting you see what changes have been staged, but does not show you information
regarding the project history

6.)$ git log Vehicle.h

7.)$ git log --grep=file

8.)Inheritance: Ensures that code can be reused, and properties of a class can be inherited and extended by other classes
Polymorphism: The idea that variables can exist in many forms
Encapsulation: Allows for data to be easily protected from outside code, binding it as a single unit

9.) Integration Manager: Integration and implementation can happen at any time
Dictator and Lieutenants: These have to happen at the dictator's branch

10.) In a dictator's workflow, the changes and merges are done in the lieutenants's branches, meaning that changes can be made independently.
In a centralized workflow, the changes have to be made in the central branch, meaning each developer has to pull the 
changes by themselves
